# IP Address Basics

## What is an IP Address?
An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to a device on a network. It allows devices to communicate with each other over the internet or local networks.

## Types of IP Addresses
- **IPv4**: 32-bit address, written in dotted decimal format (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
- **IPv6**: 128-bit address, written in hexadecimal format (e.g., `2001:0db8::1`)

## Private vs Public IP Addresses
- **Private IP Ranges**:
  - 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
  - 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
  - 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255
- **Public IPs**: Routable over the internet

## Static vs Dynamic
- **Static IP**: Manually assigned and doesn’t change
- **Dynamic IP**: Assigned by DHCP server and may change periodically
