# OSI Model Overview

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in 7 distinct layers.

## The 7 Layers (Top to Bottom)
1. **Application (Layer 7)** – User-facing protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP)
2. **Presentation (Layer 6)** – Data formatting, encryption, compression
3. **Session (Layer 5)** – Session management between systems
4. **Transport (Layer 4)** – Reliable data transfer (TCP/UDP)
5. **Network (Layer 3)** – Routing and IP addressing (e.g., IP, ICMP)
6. **Data Link (Layer 2)** – MAC addresses, frames, switches
7. **Physical (Layer 1)** – Cables, connectors, electrical signals
